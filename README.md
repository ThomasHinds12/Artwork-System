# Artwork-System
An artwork system that I developed for an assigment in Semester 1 or my third year studying Computer Science at Strathclyde.
The system uses a phpMyAdmin SQL database made up of paintings (that I did myself) to populate a dynamic art listings page. When a painting is selected the user is taken to a page for that painting and can order it.
When a painting is ordered the details using the form, the details for the order are stored in another SQL database. 
Another database is used to store track and trace appointments which can be made via another page.
The contents of the Orders and Appointments tables can be viewed on the admin page. The password for which is "letMEin2020"
