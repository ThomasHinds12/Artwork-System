            <h3>About Cara</h3>
            <p>
                Cara is a street artist who started painting on the streets of Edinburgh at the age of 18.
                Her work is mostly vibrant stencil work using solid blocks of colour which she paints using spray paint on a variety of materials.
                Her work is usually heavily inspired by pop culture and public figures and you can see some examples of her work on the street in the images above.
            </p>
            <p>
                Cara is now based in Glasgow, Scotland where she has setup her own Gallery in the Merchant City. Here she sells all her new original pieces.
            </p>
            <p>
                Several of her works are available for purchase via the <a href = "listings.php">Art Listings</a> page and you can also <a href = "booking.php">book an appointment</a> if you wish to visit the gallery and view the art.
